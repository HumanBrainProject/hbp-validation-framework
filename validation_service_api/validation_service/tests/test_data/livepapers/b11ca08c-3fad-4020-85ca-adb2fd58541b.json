    "abstract": "Experimental and clinical studies of consciousness identify brain states (i.e., transient, relevant features of the brain associated with the state of consciousness) in a non-systematic manner and largely independent from the research into the induction of state changes. In this narrative review with a focus on patients with a disorder of consciousness (DoC), we synthesize advances on the identification of brain states associated with consciousness in animal models and physiological (sleep), pharmacological (anesthesia) and pathological (DoC) states of altered consciousness in human. We show that in reduced consciousness the frequencies in which the brain operates are slowed down and that the pattern of functional communication in the brain is sparser, less efficient, and less complex. The results also\nhighlight damaged resting state networks, in particular the default mode network, decreased connectivity in long-range connections and in the thalamocortical loops. Next, we show that therapeutic approaches to treat DoC, through pharmacology (e.g., amantadine, zolpidem), and (non-)invasive brain stimulation (e.g., transcranial current stimulation, deep brain stimulation) have shown some effectiveness to promote consciousness recovery. It seems that these deteriorated features of conscious\nbrain states may improve in response to these neuromodulation approaches, yet, targeting often remains non-specific and does not always lead to (behavioral) improvements. Furthermore, in silico model-based approaches allow the development of personalized assessment of the effect of treatment on brain-wide dynamics. Although still in infancy, the fields of brain state identification and neuromodulation of brain states in relation to consciousness are showing fascinating developments that, when united, might propel the development of new and better targeted techniques for DoC. For example, brain states could be identified in a predictive setting, and the theoretical and empirical testing (i.e., in animals, under anesthesia and patients with a DoC) of neuromodulation techniques to promote consciousness could be investigated. This review further helps to identify where challenges and opportunities lay for the maturation of brain state research in the context of states of consciousness. Finally, it aids in recognizing possibilities and obstacles for the clinical translation of these diagnostic techniques and neuromodulation treatment options across both the multi-modal and multi-species approaches outlined throughout the review. This paper presents interactive figures, supported by the Live Paper initiative of the Human Brain Project, enabling the interaction with data and figures illustrating the concepts in the paper through EBRAINS (go to https://wiki.ebrains.eu/bin/view/Collabs/live-paper-states-altered-consciousness and get started with an EBRAINS account).",
